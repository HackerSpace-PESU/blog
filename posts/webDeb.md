## Step 1 : How do Websites Work

To begin we first need to know the basics of how websites work.

In its most basic form, websites are just a bunch of files stored on a server that is connected to the internet and these files can be accessed by any one using a web browser.

Now we come to the first big division in web development specifically:
 * The Front-end (Client Side)
 * The Back-end (Server Side)

### Front End Web Development

Front-end deals with the client side of the website or in other words is the interface the user interacts with when accessing the website.

### Back End Web Development

Back-end deals with the server side of a website in other words it physically stores and deals with all the files and data relating to a website.

### Let's Look at an Example

<img src="../../img/WebDevImg/restaurant.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="height: 20em;" />

Think about a restaurant. When a new customer enters, he or she first sits near a table and asks the waiter to take their order. The person sitting in the restaurant gets to enjoy the comfortable furniture, the beautiful paintings, soothing music and approachable waiters all of which ends up creating a very good ambiance. But there is also the other side of the restaurant, the kitchen. Here there are many things happening behind the scenes like restocking the food, preparing the dishes and desserts etc. Finally the customer is served food by the waiter.

From this example we can see that the customer or client utilizes the front-end of the restaurant while he/she is served food that was prepared from the back-end, the kitchen.

Developers that specialize in the front-end are referred to as **Front-end Developers** and those who specialize in the back-end are referred to as **Back-end Developers**.
It is always better to have at least some knowledge in both these areas.

Finally those who specialize in both the front-end and back-end are known as **Full Stack Developers**.

Now that we know our basics, the next step is to enter the world of front-end or client side development.

## Step 2 : Basic Front End Web Development

The three basic pillars of client side development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

<img src="../../img/WebDevImg/pillars.jpg"
     alt=""
     style="height: 20em;" />

**HTML** : HyperText MarkUp language is the markup language used to create and design webpages. It consists of a series of elements that tells the browser how to display content. In simple terms it's the skeleton of a webpage.

**CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are used to add custom styling and elaborate layouts for your webpages to make them aesthetically pleasing. 

**JS**: JavaScript is a client side programming language. It can change and update HTML and CSS. It can also be used to manipulate and validate data. It basically gives functionality to a website.

     style="height: 20em;" />

Hence by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript we can create truly structured, aesthetically pleasing and functional websites.

## Step 3 : Advanced Front-end and Javascript Frameworks

Once you are confident with the three pillars. The next step would be to increase your productivity during development to save time and focus your effort into other things. We can do this with the help of CSS and JS frameworks that provide you with methods to use preexisting code or reuse code that you have already written, so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel each time you use it. 

**CSS Frameworks** allow you to add styling to your webpage just by adding the appropriate class names to your various HTML elements. An example such as **Bootstrap** helps you to speed up the development process by using already existing code and tweaking it using manual CSS to suit your needs.

     style="height: 20em;" />

**JS Frameworks** are a collection of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code for routine programming tasks. Frameworks provide you with structures to jumpstart your development process by helping you to handle the state of your components or by handling web requests  and also allowing you to create **single page applications** which are presently the norm. Currently the three most popular frameworks are React, Angular and Vue.js.

     style="height: 20em;" />

Another important thing is to ensure that the websites you create are compatible for different screen sizes be it a laptop, phone or tablet. This brings us to the concept of responsive web design . 

**Responsive Web Design** is an approach to building websites whose CSS properties can adapt to various screen sizes such as for a mobile or tablet and for different orientations such as landscape and portrait. This can be achieved by the use of **CSS media queries**.

## Step 4 : Basic Back End Development

The backend (server-side) is the portion of the website you don't normally see; however It is responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. To do this you first need to choose a backend framework so that development becomes easy and systematic.

**Back End Frameworks** are libraries of server-side programming languages that help build the backend structure of a website. You can work on a variety of frameworks based on the programming languages you know. Examples would be Django and flask using Python and Node js using JavaScript and many more.

<img src="../../img/WebDevImg/backEndFrameworks.png"
     alt=""
     style="height: 20em;" />

An important role of a backend developer is to create APIs using backend frameworks.

**Application Program Interfaces** or APIs are used so that the front-end can access data stored in a database or business logic through the back-end. Using APIs we can perform the create, read, update and delete commonly known as CRUD operations on data. They can be created using Node js and Express.

<img src="../../img/WebDevImg/api.png"
     alt=""
     style="height: 20em;" />

As mentioned before, APIs are used to access data and business logic. But this data has to be stored in a database. A **Database** is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. In modern websites there are situations where we must store the user’s input or provide stored data, to achieve this we use databases.

The two basic types are:

 * SQL: It is relational and is implemented using tables. They are preferred for highly structured data. An example would be MySQL.  

 * NoSQL: It is non relational and is implemented using dynamic schemas. Preferred when data is unstructured. An example would be MongoDB.

# Tips:
 * It is always better to have at least some knowledge in both front-end and back-end, because you will need both of them in most of your projects.

 * While deciding which framework to choose, think about the requirements of your project and also the properties of the various frameworks that can allow you to build your website more easily and efficiently.
