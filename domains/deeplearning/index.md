## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subdomain of the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence that relies on advanced techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks and Representational Learning. It's come to be known as **Deep Learning** due to the usage of multiple Hidden Layers in the network.
It is an important sub-domain of Artificial Intelligence, inspired by the way humans think and work. 

Deep Learning has many, many applications (including, but not limited to the following -)
* Applications to Other Areas of Machine Learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Speech Recognition
* BioInformatics
* Medical Image Analysis
* Drug Design
and many more such areas.

## The History of Deep Learning

Deep learning was actually conceptualized in the 1970s. Most of the important concepts were developed in the 1980s, and the only reason they weren't used was the resource constraints!

As we all know, the hardware capabilities went up, so did the use of deep learning algorithms - they're now almost everywhere! The Future is AI. (There's a high chance of Robots taking over all of Humanity!)

## Where do you get started?

As a beginner, AI can be intimidating. There are so many things, so many frameworks, a ton of resources and it's hard to start off.

There are definitely many prerequisites, but the best way to go about it is to have an intuitive understanding of the algorithm, and work your way to the math, and as for the frameworks, there are many and itâ€™s always best to start off with well documented ones like Keras and Tensorflow. And of course, as a beginner, one will have many doubts, and there are many ways to get started with, as it depends on the person and perspective, head over to the HackerSpace discord, to chat with our mentors and try to figure out the best course of actions 

## How can We Help you?

Here at hackerspace, we have implemented a bunch of amazing DL projects, in the domain of Conputer Vision and NLP, you can always check them out on our Github account, and discuss them on our Discord Server!
