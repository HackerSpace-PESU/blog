There has been a vast increase in the hype as well as the demand for Machine Learning over the last century, especially in the last few years. With the advent of powerful computational machines, ideas once imagined decades ago are now being implemented in reality.

But is Machine Learning really that groundbreaking? Is it overrated or does it deserve the hype? Are we glorifying basic statistics?

!["machine learning is statistice?"](/img/domains/ml/101/1.jpeg)

Is this true? Let us figure it out together.

!["chaliye shuru karte hain"](/img/domains/ml/101/2.jpg)

Machine Learning mainly focuses on building applications that learn from data and keep improving themselves over time without being explicitly programmed to do so.

A Machine Learning algorithm is written by making sure they train themselves in finding patterns and features in mountains of data provided to it, so that it makes predictions when new data is provided to it.
The better the algorithm - the better the predictions. Data also plays a huge part, since as more and more data is provided to the algorithm, it gets better and better at it's task. An analogous example would be the way young children are taught to idenitfy animals. To identify an animal (let us assume a dog), you would show them pictures of a dog. Now if you would show them the picture of a small wolf, chances are they will be confused! So how do we get the kid to learn what is a dog and what is not? That's right - we show them **more** pictures of a dog. That is exactly how machine learning algorithms are trained.

As Machine Learning depends on data to improve itself, naturally you would expect it to be bad at first but as you put in more data, it gets better and better.

You might think that Machine Learning is a very new concept and was invented recently but that's actually not true, the first Machine Learning algorithm was written way back in 1952 by Arthur Samuel, who wrote a program for a game of checkers where the computer would keep getting better and better as it played more and more. The problem at that time was the computational power and capabilities - which was not enough for large scale applications. Theoretical research on Machine Learning has been going on for a long time, and only in recent times the hardware has caught up with it and now we have large scale applications of machine learning.

# Applications of Machine Learning

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing or NLP, is a subset of machine learning. In language processing, the model is trained to analyse text written in a tweet or an image for various purposes. You might have observed "this claim is disputed" written below a tweet which seems suspicious on Twitter.
You might've also seen a link that directs you to COVID related resources when a tweet or a post has COVID related content. Text recognition is used to detect and put the necessary descriptions below them.
I know the below isn't the actual thing done by Twitter and its just a meme, but this is a fun blog and I don't want to include politics in it.

## Image Recognition

If you have seen the TV series "The Big Bang Theory", you might remember the episode where they try to make an app where in if you click pictures of a differential equation it will solve it for you. In reality, there _is_ an app called **PhotoMath** which actually does that. It uses image recognition techniques to detect what is the question in the picture you clicked and solves it to provide the answer to it. You guys can download the app and check it out yourselves!

Not just that, the club's Computer Vision team has worked on two different projects that use image recognition.

One is a dog breed classier which when provided with an image, classifies the breed of the dog. You can check it out [here](http://bit.ly/hsp-breed-classifier).

Here is another project which detects your hand position and maps it on a canvas! You can check it out [here](http://bit.ly/hsp-handDetect).

## Recommendation Systems

Shopping malls or supermarkets use this great strategy of keeping products we love to eat like chips, chocolates etcetera near the billing counter which makes you add something at the last minute and increases your bill, but its difficult for online vendors like Amazon to do that. So what they do instead is look at shopping patterns of people - what they are buying, what customers view after adding a certain item to their cart and so on. How many times have we come across related products or even other reccomended products while hopping on these sites? By doing this, Amazon is able to suggest other items to customers based on their previous buying patterns and also earn profits by selling more items.

**Future Prediction:**

!["Lekin! Sirf past performance pe mat ja, aage kya hoga kisi kop nahi malum"](/img/domains/ml/101/9.jpg)

This is what Sharma ji said in the Mutual Funds advertisement, which is true to some extent but there are many Machine Learning algorithms that are used these days for future predictions - few being weather prediction, stock market prediction and so on. It is even used by analysts in sports to analyse player's performance, their strengths and weaknesses to make game plans.

My team and I have worked on a [Project](http://bit.ly/hsp-cricket11) that tries to predict the best possible 11 for cricket fantasy leagues. You can use it to make your fantasy teams too. 
**Ab kaam aap karlo, Dream 11 pe team hum banayenge!**

Now let us trace back to a statement we came across earlier, is machine learning just glorified statistics?
